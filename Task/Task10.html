Task 2: Style a Specific Element by ID

<div id="header">This is a header</div>
Instructions: Use the HTML code to create a `<div>` element with the `id` attribute set to "header." Then, apply CSS styles to this specific element to customize its appearance. For example, you can set a background color and text color for this header.

Task 3: Style Elements by Class

<p class="highlight">This is a highlighted paragraph.</p>

  <li>Item 1</li>
